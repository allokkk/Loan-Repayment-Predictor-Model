# Loan-Repayment-Predictor-Model


##
- The objective of this project is to accurately predict weather or not a borrower of a loan will pay the loan in full or no
- As an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to    create a model that will help predict this.
- In order to accurately predict this, we create a Decision tree and a Random forest in order to obtain Classification report and Confusion matrix from the testing set. The program should be able to train itself by obtaining a training set from the given data set and then run a test set on the trained model in order to predict the desired outcome. Furthermore, it gives us its accuracy measures which we can obtain from the Classification report.
- These results obtained from the DECISION TREE and RANDOM FOREST are then compared in order to find out which method is optimal, as per the requirements.

### Datasets

- credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.
- purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values "credit_card", "debt_consolidation", "educational", "major_purchase", "small_business", and "all_other").

- installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.
- log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.
- dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).
- fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.
- days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.
- revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).
- revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).
- inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.
- delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.
